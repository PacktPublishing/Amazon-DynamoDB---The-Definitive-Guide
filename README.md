## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', region_name='eu-west-2')
table = dynamodb.Table('DefinitiveGuide01')
response = table.scan()
items = response['Items']

print(items)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for software architects designing scalable systems, developers optimizing performance with DynamoDB, and engineering managers guiding decision-making. Data engineers will learn to integrate DynamoDB into workflows, while product owners will explore its innovative capabilities. DBAs transitioning to NoSQL will find valuable insights on DynamoDB and RDBMS integration. Basic knowledge of software engineering, Python, and cloud computing is helpful. Hands-on AWS or DynamoDB experience is beneficial but not required.

## To get the most out of this book
We recommend reading AWS DynamoDB Developer Guide alongside this book to get a comprehensive
view of the specifics. Given that technology evolves, some limits or feature supports may have been
updated since the book was published. Note also that console screenshots may differ from the latest
version, but features and functionalities remain consistent. For the latest details, always refer to the
AWS documentation. This book complements the documentation by offering insights and best practices
drawn from more than a decade of combined DynamoDB and NoSQL experience.

While trying out the code examples can enrich your understanding, it is not mandatory. Note that
using AWS features may incur costs, typically between $2 and $5 if resources are utilized and deleted
within the same hour, with costs potentially increasing if resources remain active longer.
